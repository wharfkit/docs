The `Struct` class is one in which developers can extend in order to define core or [ABI](#) type objects for use in the [Serializer](#).

The [ContractKit](#) will automatically generate `Struct` objects during its code generation process.

As an example, the [open source](https://github.com/greymass/unicove) project [Unicove.com](https://unicove.com) uses a small library of `Struct` classes to manually define the known smart contract actions it allows users to perform. These types are all defined here:

https://github.com/greymass/unicove/blob/dev/src/abi-types.ts

These types are then imported into the application logic and used whenever transaction data is being assembled to automatically serialize the data.

The [abi2core](#) library can also be used to read a smart contract's ABI and automatically generate these instances of `Struct` for a project.

## Defining Structs

Each `Struct` can either be written to use TypeScript's [experimental decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#experimentalDecorators) or written more verbosely in plain Javascript. 

This is an example of the `eosio.token` contract and its `transfer` action, written both using the experimental decorators and then in plain javascript.

```ts
// Using experimentalDecorators in TypeScript
@Struct.type('transfer')
export class Transfer extends Struct {
    @Struct.field(Name) from!: Name
    @Struct.field(Name) to!: Name
    @Struct.field(Asset) quantity!: Asset
    @Struct.field('string') memo!: string
}

// Using plain JavaScript
class Transfer extends Struct {
    static abiName = 'transfer'
    static abiFields = [
      {
        name: 'from',
        type: Name,
      },
      {
        name: 'to',
        type: Name,
      },
      {
        name: 'quantity',
        type: Asset,
      },
      {
        name: 'memo',
        type: 'string',
      },
    ]
}
```

## Using Structs

Once a `Struct` class is defined, they can be used to define the data within an [Action](#) without needing the ABI. Utilizing the definitions from the section above, a token `transfer` action can be written as:

```ts
const data = Transfer.from({
    from: 'teamgreymass',
    to: 'funds.gm',
    quantity: '0.0001 EOS',
    memo: ''
})
```

These can also be passed directly into an [Action](#) for automatic serialization.

```ts
const action = Action.from({
    account: 'eosio.token',
    name: 'transfer',
    authorization: [{ actor: 'foo', permission: 'active' }],
    data: Transfer.from({
        from: 'teamgreymass',
        to: 'funds.gm',
        quantity: '0.0001 EOS',
        memo: ''
    })
})
```
